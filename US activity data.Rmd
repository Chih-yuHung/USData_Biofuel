## US activity data from NIR 2024 

In this RMD file, I'm describing how US collect their activity data related to SOC change and N2O emissions. I need this data (less than their requirements) 
1. land base and history data
2. crop-specific mineral nitrogen fertilizer rate and timing
3. tillage practices
4. weahter data (in other RMD files, "Climate Normals" and "Weather data preparation" )
5. edaphic characteristics (in other RMD files)


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
