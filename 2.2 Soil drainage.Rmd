## Soil drainage data from SSURGO

The Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) collected by the National Cooperative Soil Survey over the course of a century. 
(https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/resources/data-and-reports/soil-survey-geographic-database-ssurgo)

They provide an R package, soilDB, to obtain data from SSURGO

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
source("setup.R")

```


## Soil drainage data

Every state has multiple mukeys, which are the least survey unit in SSURGO. 


```{r Loop all state for soil saturation}
# Loop through each state abbreviation in state_crosswalk
# Initialize an empty dataframe to store results
all_states_texture_summary <- data.frame()

# Loop through each state abbreviation in state_crosswalk
for (state_code in state_crosswalk$abbr) {
  cat(state_code)
  # Query soil attributes from muaggatt
  saturation_data <- get_SDA_muaggatt(
  WHERE = paste0("areasymbol LIKE '", state_code, "%'")) %>%
  select(mukey, wtdepannmin, wtdepaprjunmin, drclassdcd, hydclprs, pondfreqprs)
  
  
 # Fetch area data using mukey from get_mapunit_from_SDA()
  area_data <- get_mapunit_from_SDA(
    WHERE = paste0("areasymbol LIKE '", state_code, "%'")
  ) %>% select(mukey, muacres)

  # Merge both datasets by mukey
  soil_saturation_area <- left_join(saturation_data, area_data, by = "mukey")
  
  #Filter data to find flood prone soils, but not flooded 
  saturation_prone_soils <- soil_saturation_area %>%
  filter(
    wtdepaprjunmin <= 30 ,  # Shallow water table (â‰¤30 cm)
    drclassdcd %in% c("Poorly drained","Somewhat poorly drained", "Very poorly drained"),  
    # Low drainage capacity
    hydclprs > 10,  # Hydric soils (likely to retain water) high
    #hydclprs > 40,  # Hydric soils (likely to retain water)  low
    pondfreqprs <= 30  # No significant ponding (to exclude flooded soils) high
    #pondfreqprs <= 10  # No significant ponding (to exclude flooded soils) low
  )

  
  # Calculate total area 
  total_area <- sum(soil_saturation_area$muacres, na.rm = TRUE)
  total_saturation_area <- sum(saturation_prone_soils$muacres, na.rm = TRUE)

  # Compute percentage of each poor drainage area
  Topo <- total_saturation_area/total_area
  
  cat(paste0(state_code,Topo,""))
  # Create a summary dataframe for the state
  state_texture_summary <- data.frame(
    State = state_code,
    Total_Area_Acres = total_area,
    Total_Saturation_Area = total_saturation_area,
    Topo = Topo
  )

  # Append to the final results dataframe
  all_states_texture_summary <- bind_rows(all_states_texture_summary, state_texture_summary)
}

all_states_texture_summary <- all_states_texture_summary %>%
  left_join(state_crosswalk, by = c("State" = "abbr")) %>%
  select(-State) %>%
  rename(State = full) %>%
  mutate(State = toupper(State))

#write.csv(all_states_texture_summary,"Outputs/2.2_Soil topo_low.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(all_states_texture_summary,"Outputs/2.2_Soil topo_high.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```
