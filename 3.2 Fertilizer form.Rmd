## To obtain fertilizer types in different regions in the US. 

The methodologies to estimate fertilizer types (% for various types) are developed by Cao et al. 
Although it's not crop sepcific and only estimated the proportion to 2015 (and before). 

Only corn has the exception. 
Nitrogen fertilizer types of corn is estimated ny Cooter et al., 2012. 

Thanks to Prof. Lu provided their data. (Feb 4, 2025)

    sheet = "Fertilizer form") 
#The percentages don't add up to 100% becasue it has manure. NEED to convert to Synthetic N fertilizer only

#Use Farm production region (FPR from 3.1 Fertilzation rate.Rmd)

#write the data
#write.csv(Fertilizer_form_corn, "Outputs/Fertilizer_form_corn.csv",row.names = FALSE)

## Extract the figure in Cao and calculate the proportion. 

The figure is save to "Fertilizer"
