## Check interannual distribution of Precipitation and PET 

The purpose is to know if the precipitation and PET are not evenly distributed between growing seasons (April to September) and non-growing seasons (Nov-April).

```{r }
# Function to calculate the 30-year average of precipitation in growing season vs. non-growing season.
calculate_30y_avg_rain <- function(data) {
  # Define the growing season months (May to October) and non-growing season (November to April)
  months_grow <- sprintf("%02d", 5:10)  # May to October, padded with zero
  months_nongrow <- sprintf("%02d", c(1:4, 11:12))  # November to April

  # Define the years range (1981-2010)
  years <- 1981:2010

  # Initialize empty matrices to store the annual totals for growing and non-growing seasons
  annual_totals_grow <- matrix(NA, nrow = nrow(data), ncol = length(years))
  annual_totals_nongrow <- matrix(NA, nrow = nrow(data), ncol = length(years))
  colnames(annual_totals_grow) <- years
  colnames(annual_totals_nongrow) <- years

  # Loop through each year and sum the precipitation for both seasons
  for (year in years) {
    # Column names for growing and non-growing seasons
    cols_grow <- paste0("P_", year, months_grow)
    cols_nongrow <- paste0("P_", year, months_nongrow)

    # Check if all required columns exist in the data
    if (all(cols_grow %in% names(data))) {
      annual_totals_grow[, as.character(year)] <- rowSums(data[, cols_grow], na.rm = TRUE)
    } else {
      warning(paste("Some growing season columns for year", year, "are missing. Skipping."))
    }

    if (all(cols_nongrow %in% names(data))) {
      annual_totals_nongrow[, as.character(year)] <- rowSums(data[, cols_nongrow], na.rm = TRUE)
    } else {
      warning(paste("Some non-growing season columns for year", year, "are missing. Skipping."))
    }
  }

  # Calculate the 30-year average for each row (county/state)
  data$Avg_P_grow <- rowMeans(annual_totals_grow, na.rm = TRUE)
  data$Avg_P_nongrow <- rowMeans(annual_totals_nongrow, na.rm = TRUE)

  return(data)
}

# Apply function and select relevant columns
Rain.avg <- calculate_30y_avg_rain(Rain) %>%
            select(County, State, Avg_P_grow, Avg_P_nongrow)
